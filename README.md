These files are excerpts from a project for the 2025 ASI Summit done with two peers and Dr. Joochul Lee.

This was my first experience working on a data project during my math undergrad. There was a lot of learning, 
but afterwards I felt very competent with different data storage types like JSON and making API calls. One of our 
collaborators, Jojo, gave a presentation at Rice University, which slides are available in this respository.

Our goal was to examine midfielder efficiency provided our access to frame by frame x,y coordinate data.
